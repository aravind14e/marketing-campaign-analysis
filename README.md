# Marketing Campaign Data Analysis

This project contains exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a marketing campaign dataset using Python in Google Colab. The goal is to understand customer behavior and extract insights that can help improve campaign strategies.

## Dataset

File: `marketing_campaign_data.csv`  
The dataset includes customer demographic and behavioral information such as:
- Age
- Income
- Marital status
- Number of purchases
- Campaign responses
- Spending on various product categories

## Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Perform exploratory data analysis
- Identify trends and patterns in customer behavior
- Visualize the data to support findings
- Understand how customer attributes impact campaign responses

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Google Colab
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
